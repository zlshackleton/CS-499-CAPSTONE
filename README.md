# CS-499-CAPSTONE
The final step in my journey toward a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science, by completing a capstone that integrates the knowledge and skills that I have developed throughout the program by creating a professional electronic portfolio (ePortfolio) that demonstrates my growth in the program.

## 24hrClock Enhancement 1
For this enhancement, I sought to improve the user interface as they navigated through the console.

## BufferOverflow Enhancement 2
This enhancement was leveraged to teach me more about secure coding practices such as hashing + salt.

## AdvisorCourseList Enhancement 3
This was by far my favorite enhancement and I leveraged its previously poor .txt file and implemented an actual database using SQLite to store course info as well as utilize CRUD capabilities.




## 📃 Self Assessment Summary
_Completing my CS coursework and building this ePortfolio through enhancements like UI implementation, legacy code refactoring, SQLite database integration, and secure coding with prepared statements has sharpened my adaptability, performance optimization skills, and commitment to robust, maintainable code. When collaborating with peers to explore multiple solutions I was able strengthen my critical thinking and cross‑functional communication, which are skill essential for devloping projects along side team members. My capstone projects (24hrClockEnhancement1, BufferOverflowEnhancement2, AdvisorCourseListEnhancement3) showcase a full development lifecycle, clear separation of concerns, and proficiency in testing, version control, and API usability._
